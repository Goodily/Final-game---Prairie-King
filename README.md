# Final-game---Prairie-King
 The inspiration for this game comes from a game I really like—Stardew Valley. In the original game, the sharpshooter needs to kill all the enemies in the area within a specific time to move on to the next level, eventually completing a three-level challenge. However, I created a simplified version of "King of the Prairie," where you only need to control the direction and shooting keys to kill 30 enemies to rescue the princess and achieve victory.

This is another game I prepared besides the group assignment.

After you press the space bar, you can enter the game. 

The character's birth point is in the center of the screen. The lower right corner is the gameplay introduction. "W, S, A, D" corresponds to the character's up, down, left, and right movements, and the arrows correspond to the shooting direction. 


Note: The shooting will only be triggered when the character's movement direction is the same as the shooting key direction.

The enemy(green gun) will move from the four gaps in the woods to your location. You need to use the direction keys to dodge the enemy and press the arrow keys to shoot to destroy the enemy.

The only condition for death is that you are touched by the enemy. 
When you die, the "restart" and "quit" interfaces will appear. Use the up and down arrow keys to make a selection and the Enter key to confirm.
If you choose restart, the character will return to the spawn point and restart the game.

The only victory condition is that you successfully kill thirty enemies, which means the game is over and you have rescued the princess.
