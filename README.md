# Final-game---Prairie-King
 The inspiration for this game comes from a game I really like—Stardew Valley. In the original game, the sharpshooter needs to kill all the enemies in the area within a specific time to move on to the next level, eventually completing a three-level challenge. However, I created a simplified version of "King of the Prairie," where you only need to control the direction and shooting keys to kill 30 enemies to rescue the princess and achieve victory.

This is another game I prepared besides the group assignment.
