# Final-game---Prairie-King
 The inspiration for this game comes from a game I really likeâ€”Stardew Valley. In the original game, the sharpshooter needs to kill all the enemies in the area within a specific time to move on to the next level, eventually completing a three-level challenge. However, I created a simplified version of "King of the Prairie," where you only need to control the direction and shooting keys to kill 30 enemies to rescue the princess and achieve victory.
